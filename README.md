# Dynamic React Website with Real-Time GitHub Data

This is a simple yet dynamic **React Router-based website** that pulls **real-time GitHub profile data**, including the followers count, using the **GitHub API**. The project demonstrates how to manage routes efficiently, fetch data from external APIs, and build a responsive and user-friendly web application.

- **Dynamic User Profile Page**: Built with URL parameters, the profile page fetches data dynamically based on the userâ€™s GitHub ID.
- **Optimized Data Loading**: Implements **React Loaders** to manage loading states while fetching GitHub data.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure the website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
